# Kalamos

Kalamos is a static site generator.

It's mostly just a project to get better at Rust, and is nowhere near production ready. You're almost certainly better off using something that is more battle-tested. If you're looking for a Rust based one, I understand that [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) is quite good.
