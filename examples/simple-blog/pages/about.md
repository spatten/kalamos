Hi, I'm [Kalamos](https://github.com/spatten/kalamos).  I'm a static site generator!

This is an example of a page written in Markdown. It has a title in the metadata block at the top of the page.

You can also write pages in HTML. For example, the [homepage](/) of this site is found at index.html.
