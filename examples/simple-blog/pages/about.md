Hi, I'm Scott Patten.  I'm a software developer based in Vancouver.

I work at [FOSSA](https://fossa.com), where we help companies use open source software safely and successfully.

In the past, I was a co-founder of [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com).

You can email me at [scott@scottpatten.ca](mailto:scott@scottpatten.ca).

My code is all hosted on GitHub at [github.com/spatten](http://github.com/spatten).
